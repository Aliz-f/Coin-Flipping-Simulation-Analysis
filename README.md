# Coin-Flipping-Simulation-Analysis
A simulation experiment analyzing the behavior of fair coin flips to explore probability distributions, using a comparison with the Hoeffding bound. The study focuses on three selected coins over multiple simulation runs and visualizes the outcomes through histograms and probability estimates.
